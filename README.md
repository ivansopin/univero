univero
=============

## About
The univero project is an attempt to simplify the creation, formatting, and retrieval of scholarly and other references on the Web; the name stands for UNIVersal Electronic Reference Organizer. In short, univero provides many researchers with an opportunity to build, modify, and maintain libraries with publication entries and corresponding resources in a properly compiled and organized format. This tool can be a tremendous help to someone who needs to quickly update their resume online or prepare references for any electronic document.

## Technologies
The entire project was built from scratch using PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, CSS, and SQLite. The original intent was to also use XML and XLST, but due to the limitations of the latter, JavaScript workarounds were found instead. Besides, the first implementation featured MySQL database, yet SQLite seemed to offer more flexibility and better performance in the scope of this project.

## Contact
The project is a work in progress. Please feel free to contact me with any comments or suggestions you might have. I am currently looking for someone who is interested in advancing univero further and making it a really universal referencing tool.
